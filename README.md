# XlsMerger
XlsMerger is a simple WPF application where you can select multiple Excel files in order to merge all of their sheets in a single file.

Technically speaking:
- I implemented `MVVM` pattern with `MvvmLightLibs`
- To communicate with Excel, I used the COM library `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel`
